## Flick Intermediate Developer Challenge

Kia Ora! Flick's homework assignment is designed to get an idea of the scope of your React knowledge. As technical challenges can be time consuming, we ask that you don't spend much more than two hours on this challenge.

If you finish the challenge, that's great, but is totally fine to only get part of the way through. We want to see how your problem solving skills; so please explain any decisions you make based on your time / knowledge constraints when you create your pull request.
## Instructions

We've set up `create-react-app` in this repo, and you should be able to get dependencies installed with `npm install` and the app running with `npm start`. If not, let us know and we'll help out. From here, we want you to build a simple admin dashboard that does some or all of the following using the accounts.json file in this project:

- A user can search for accounts based on email address. Each time the user types a letter, the search results should update.
- When the user clicks on an account search result, the account information should display
- Search results that have been clicked on are listed in a 'history' section of the browser, so that the user know what results have been viewed already.

It's up to you how you arrange the information on the screen, but this challenge is specifically looking at your react skills, so please don't spend time making the app look pretty. We aren't looking at your CSS here.

Once you're finished write a summary of your code changes, including any decisions or tradeoffs you made. Since two hours is not a lot of time, include anything you would have done or changed given more time. Create a pull request in this repo, and let us know your code is ready to review by email.

Have any questions? Please ask!

## Flick Intermediate Developer Challenge

Kia Ora! Flick's homework assignment is designed to get an idea of the scope of your React knowledge. As technical challenges can be time consuming, we ask that you don't spend much more than two hours on this challenge.
If you finish the challenge, that's great, but is totally fine to only get part of the way through. We want to see how your problem solving skills; so please explain any decisions you make based on your time / knowledge constraints when you create your pull request.
## Instructions

We've set up `create-react-app` in this repo, and you should be able to get dependencies installed with `yarn install` and the app running with `yarn run`. If not, let us know and we'll help out. From here, we want you to build an app using the Spotify API and these features:

- A user can search for an artist, and see results as they type
- A user can click on an artist to see the artist's top tracks

In this challenge we are specifically looking at your react, so please don't spend time making the app look pretty, we aren't looking at your CSS here. We recommend using the included [Spotify Web API JS](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js) library to make requests to Spotify. Example authentication code is provided in `App.js`.

Once you're finished write a summary of your code changes, including any decisions or tradeoffs you made. Since two hours is not a lot of time, include anything you would have done or changed given more time. Create a pull request in this repo, and let us know your code is ready to review by email.

Have any questions? Please ask!
